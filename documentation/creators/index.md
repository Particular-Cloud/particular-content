# Particular.Cloud for content creators and product owners

Use Particular.Cloud to manage and create texts for digital products.

## The right amount of access

We want to make your life as easy as possible.
Creating content for digitial products and services can be challenging.
It requires great collaboration and communication between developers, content creators, product owners, and translators.
We are here to provide you a service platform for collaboration.
We want to make it as easy as possible for developers to integrate text and localization and we want to support
you to create, edit, and manage content right from our web platform - without the need to edit code, JSON, or XML files.
Not even Excel sheets!

## Change content fast - even in real-time!

Don't create tickets for developers to change content. Do it yourself!
Use our modern web platform to create, edit, and manage your application's text.
You can even change content in real-time after integrating our SDKs in your product!

## A Content Management System for localized texts

You can think of Particular.Cloud as a simple content management system (CMS),
Particular.Cloud provides you all the tools to manage text for digital products.

## No vendor lock-in

We differ from other content management systems and translation platforms. There is no vendor lock-in with us!
You can download your Particular.Cloud project as JSON and just move forward without us.
